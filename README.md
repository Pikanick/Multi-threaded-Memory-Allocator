# Multi-threaded-Memory-Allocator
This project demonstrates custom memory allocation strategies in C. It includes the implementation of a simple memory allocator, `myalloc`, and a program to test its functionality. The project illustrates how memory allocation can be managed in a constrained environment and visualizes the memory blocks through a series of images.
